# Zest Assignment Test
here's my (B Nagendra Prasad) Zest Assignment Test

hi , i have done the first assignment(comparing iphone price on amazon and flipkart).

The product you mentioned "iPhone XR (64GB) - Yellow" is sometimes out of stock on amazon , so to avoid that conflict i chose "iphone xs max (64gb) gold". 

--- "TestBase" class contains all the Genric methods used in the testscript
--- page objects of amazon and flipkart are kept under "PageObjects" package


Thanks
